My name is Zoe and I like learning things! I learned to code a few years ago and have been exploring programming, computers and data ever since. 

Some fun facts about me: 

- I am the President of [**BayGeo**](https://baygeo.org/), a local Bay Area organization dedicated to bringing together geospatial and mapping enthusiasts. 
- I learned to play basketball by starting a women + non-binary basketball team 6 years ago. I played twice a week until shelter in place. My favorite team is the Warriors. My favorite player is Klay. My favorite basketball friendship is Boban + Tobias Harris. 
- I learned to knit when I was 6. The only sweater I have finished was on size 2 needles, took me 5 years, and ended up too small, but yes, I still wear it.
