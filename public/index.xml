      <description>My name is Zoe and I like learning things! I learned to code a few years ago and have been exploring programming, computers and data ever since.
Some fun facts about me:
 I am the President of BayGeo, a local Bay Area organization dedicated to bringing together geospatial and mapping enthusiasts. I learned to play basketball by starting a women + non-binary basketball team 6 years ago. I played twice a week until shelter in place.</description>

      <description>Dasparities in Compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) My master&amp;rsquo;s thesis was a spatial environmental justice investigation into violations to the SDWA in Pennsylvania. My research was published in August 2020 in Applied Geography.
I have also written a lot of code around this project and completely redid my thesis research but with New Jersey data. While unfortunately the the final website isn&amp;rsquo;t currently being hosted anywhere, all the code can be found here.</description>
