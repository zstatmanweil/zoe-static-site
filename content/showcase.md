### Dasparities in Compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)
*2018-2020*

My master's thesis was a spatial environmental justice investigation into violations to the SDWA in Pennsylvania. My research was published in August 2020 in [*Applied Geography*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0143622819304060).

I have also written a lot of code around this project and repeated my thesis research but with New Jersey data. While unfortunately the final website isn't currently being hosted anywhere, all the code can be found [here](https://github.com/zstatmanweil/EJ-analysis-map).

### Incarceration.info 
*2019*

[This site](https://incarceration.info) was a collaboration between Corin Faife and myself, and was built during the Fall 2019 batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) programming retreat in Brooklyn, NY. Charts are generated using the Altair visualization library.
